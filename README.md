# üß¨ Machine Learning for CRISPR Efficiency Enhancement: Prime Editing Focus

## üèÜ Project Overview
This project aims to develop an ML model that predicts CRISPR Prime Editing efficiency, pushing the frontiers of genetic editing by using advanced methods. Transformer architectures and Bayesian optimization are employed to model DNA/RNA sequences, improving upon existing GRU and CNN models. This project aims to develop an advanced machine learning model to predict the efficiency of CRISPR DNA editing, with a focus on Prime Editor technology. CRISPR enables precise DNA edits and has significant implications for gene therapy. We will explore transformer-based architectures and Bayesian optimization to enhance the predictive performance over existing CNN and GRU models. The dataset includes over 300,000 data points with features such as DNA target sequences, RNA guides, CRISPR efficiency scores, GC content, and melting points.
